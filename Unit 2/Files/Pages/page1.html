  <li>Labor Day originated through:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>A push to recognize the contributions off American workers to the economy</li>
      <li>A developed movement by labor activists to pass a bill to legalize Labor Day as a national holiday</li>
      <li>A realization that workers deserved to have more appreciation for the effort they put in to their jobs each day</li>
    </ol>
  </ul>
