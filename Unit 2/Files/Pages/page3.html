<h1>What Labor Day Means To Me</h1>
<hr>
</head>

<body>
  <p>Labor Day has always been a special day for me and my family. It gives us time to spend with each other right after getting back into the groove of things with school and work, and has really become a day I look forward to each year.</p>
  <br>
<p>My family and I always go to the Pana Labor Day parade in the early morning to set out chairs so we will have a spot to sit. Then later we go to our seats and we watch all the different floats go by with people promoting businesses and different organizations, throwing out candy and free goodies to the crowd. It's something that I will always love to do, seeing people I know walking in the parade, getting candy, and spending time with my family.</p>
<br>
<p>However, this year isn't going to be the same. As I continue to grow up I realize that the daily chores of life take you away from all of the fun things we got to do as kids. This year I won't be able to go to the parade with my family, but instead I have to work a shift at my job. It is a bit sad to not be able to keep up with our annual tradition, but I know that I am responsible to follow through with commitments I have made. Yet, no matter what, the memories of the Labor Day parade will stay with me forever (Labor Day Parade &gt; work) .</p>
